## Notes

### Authentication Integration

The `user_id` field links Discord bot members with Supabase authenticated users, enabling:

- **Unified identity**: Same member record for both Discord bot and web app
- **Auth-based queries**: Look up members by their Supabase auth UUID
- **Permission management**: Link member roles with Supabase auth policies

**Workflow Example:**
1. User signs up via web app (Supabase Auth creates user)
2. User links Discord account
3. Bot creates/updates member record with `user_id`
4. Web app can now query member by `user_id` to show Discord bot stats

### Club Association Management

When updating clubs:
- Providing an empty array `[]` removes all club associations
- Not providing the `clubs` field leaves associations unchanged
- Invalid club IDs in the array will be skipped with errors logged

### Points and Books Read

- Points typically increment when members complete readings on time
- Books read increments when a member finishes a book
- These fields are managed by your application logic (not automatically updated)
